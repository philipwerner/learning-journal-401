#Python 401 Day Two Learning Journal

I feel a lot better after today, very relieved that I was able to get everything I missed yesterday. It was
also very nice to get my Sublime set up properly and the virtualenv running and know how to use them. Much
better day today. The assignment was fun, pretty straight forward, really happy to be focusing on writing tests, all my dev friends tell me that they are a big part of getting a job, so.....YESS!
